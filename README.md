# UnityHDRPSimpleWater
Simple water shader prepared with ShaderGraph in Unity 2018.3.6. Has still a lot more work to be done but still might be of use to someone so here it is :) Not likely to get updated frequently but will be updated eventually.

# Update
Added waving and a crude way of edge foam. Will improve but still should be useful enough :)

# How to
Just drag 1 or 2 normal maps to the textures and have fun with the settings :)

Settings(Skipping obvious ones like the main color):

Top Color: The outside color of the fresnel effect.

Speed: Sets the speed of blending. Can get jiggy on high speeds.

AngleDim: Sets the power of the fresnel effect (The color changes depending on your angle of view)

Smooth: Specular smooth.

# To-do
-Wave controls

-Preventing "intersection repeats". You'll notice probably after tweaking it some time.

-Foam thickness controls
