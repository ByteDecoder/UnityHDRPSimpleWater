# UnityHDRPSimpleWater
Simple water shader prepared with ShaderGraph in Unity 2018.3.6. Has still a lot more work to be done but still might be of use to someone so here it is :) Not likely to get updated frequently but will be updated eventually.

# How to
Just drag 1 or 2 normal maps to the textures and have fun with the settings :)

Settings(Skipping obvious ones like the main color):

Top Color: The outside color of the fresnel effect.

Speed: Sets the speed of blending. Can get jiggy on high speeds.

AngleDim: Sets the power of the fresnel effect (The color changes depending on your angle of view)

Smooth: Specular smooth.

# To-do
-Actual vertex moving waves. I know how to do it but do not have the time for that yet. Will come eventually. 

-Preventing "intersection repeats". You'll notice probably after tweaking it some time.

-Foam on the edges.
